Each data file (txt file) includes T strings, in which T is the length of the motion sequence.
The string format is like: (X_0, Y_0, Z_0,X_1, Y_1, Z_1,X_2, Y_2, Z_2,..., X_32, Y_32, Z_32), representing the keypoint positions of human joint.
Z direction is the depth direction of the camera, it is ranged in (-1, 1).
The illustration of human joints is shown in the image (same as the mediapipe model).
